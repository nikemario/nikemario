Hi, I'm Hannah! I'm a recent graduate of Southern Utah University with my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I'm most comfortable writing in Java & Python, as those are the languages I've spent the most time with.
I also have some experience with SQL, C/C++, HTML/CSS/Javascript, Swift, and Kotlin.

I'm most interested in back-end work & am always open to learning something new!
