Hi, I'm Hannah! I'm a 2023 graduate of <a href="www.suu.edu">Southern Utah University</a> <img src="https://1000logos.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Southern-Utah-Thunderbirds-logo-500x281.png" alt="Southern Utah University's bird head logo" height="15" width="28"/> with my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I'm most comfortable writing in Java & Python, as those are the languages I've spent the most time with.
I also have some experience with SQL, C/C++, HTML/CSS/Javascript, Swift, and Kotlin.

I'm most interested in back-end work & am always open to learning something new!
